## Presentation

This page lays the foundations of ethics in a society composed of individuals.

One relies on [this article](https://leibnizproject.com/Articles/ethics_first_steps.html).

--MATH_START--
Throughout this page, let $I$ the finite set of individuals of a society, $S$ be the set of states and $A$ the set of actions.

## Profiles and subjective states

An action profile is given by the action of each individual.

--MATH_START--
$\mathbf{Definition}$\
The set $AP$ of action profiles is $A^I$.
--MATH_END--

[//]: # Rocq (13-13)

A subjective state is a situation seen in a specific individual's perspective.

--MATH_START--
$\mathbf{Definition}$\
The set $SubjS$ of subjective states is $S × I$.
--MATH_END--

[//]: # Rocq (15-36)

An individual ethic tells for each subjective state if a given action is "right" or "wrong". As a subjective state can put anyone's shoes, so can an individual ethic.

--MATH_START--
$\mathbf{Definition}$\
The set $IE$ of individual ethics is ${\{⊥ ,⊤\}}^{SubjS × A}$.
--MATH_END--

An ethical profile gives the ethic of each individual.

--MATH_START--
$\mathbf{Definition}$\
The set $EP$ of ethical profiles is $IE^I$.

$\mathbf{Definition}$\
Individuals $i, j \in I$ of an ethical profile $ep$ are said to have the same ethic in a subjective state $subjS$ if $\forall a \in A, ep(i)(SubjS, a) = ep(j)(SubjS, a)$.

$\mathbf{Definition}$\
Individuals $i, j \in I$ of an ethical profile $ep$ are said to always have the same ethic if $\forall subjS \in SubjS,$ $i$ and $j$ have the same ethic in $subjS$ .
