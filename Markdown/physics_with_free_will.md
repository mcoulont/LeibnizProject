## Presentation

There is some kind of existential issue in admitting that the physical rules of the world are deterministic: then, as we are part of this world, all of our actions and thoughts are (in theory) perfectly predictable and at least predetermined. But this removes our free will and can eventually be dangerous for the society, as it implies that no one is responsible for his actions.

Here is described a frame in which an individual sees the outer world as a deterministic one but his actions remain his.

--MATH_START--
Throughout this page, let $T$ be the set of instants in the unfolding of time. If $t, t' \in T$, $t \le t'$ means that the instant $t$ is before (or simultaneous with) $t'$. \
Let $S$ be the set of states and $A$ be the set of actions.

Some definitions in [this article](https://www.leibnizproject.com/Articles/physical_theories.html) are used.

## Determinism except for free will

If one takes the perspective of an individual, it perceives the world with its captors and acts by motions.

With this subjective approach, the rules of the world (as perceived by our individual) are deterministic if a given state at a given instant together with the following individual's actions determine all the other states after that instant.

One can potentially assimilate our individual to mankind in order to be less subjective. Then the actions are the sum of actions of everyone and the single free will for mankind can be seen as the sum of all the free wills.

In our definition below, every action is considered feasible in every physical theory mostly by convenience, but it's consistent with actions/movements fired by neural signals: the intended action may not happen but we have tried.

$\mathbf{Definition}$\
A physical theory $pt \in {\{⊥ ,⊤\}}^{S^T}$ is said deterministic except for free will if $$\forall h_1, h_2 \in (S \times A)^T \text{ whose projections satisfy both } pt \text{ and such that } h_1(t_0) = h_2(t_0) \text{ for a given } t_0 \in T, \forall t \gt t_0, (\text{all the actions between } t_0 \text{ and } t \text{ are equal in } h_1 \text{ and } h_2 \Rightarrow h_1(t) = h_2(t))$$
